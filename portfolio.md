## Identifying and Defining 
### Identifying a Need
**BRAINSTORM**
- Pretty world in 3D with 2D elements where you explore the city, talk to people and pick up trash to spread awareness about urban pollution while calming players
- Volleyball-esque game on UNITY that is low-stakes, charming and simple that can be played to help people improve hand-eye coordination, and timing while still having fun.

### Requirements Outline
**Inputs** - We will require inputs like the ↑ ↓ → ← keys for player movement as well as the space bar for hitting the ball. Another input you would need is the ball going over the net and the ball touching the ground. 

**Processes** - My project should be able to identify and process ↑ ↓ → ← key inputs and make the player move a set distance with the player running animation. Similarly, the system should be able to process the space bar and perform the player hitting action. 

**Outputs** - You can move your player around and hit the ball. When the ball goes over the net, the score should increase one point, but when the ball touches the ground, the game and rally score should reset. 

**Transmission** - My project should be able to transmit rally score into  high score in the start/reset menu.

**Storage** - Each time the ball goes over the net the game should store one point for the rally score, which the player should be able to see the whole time.
